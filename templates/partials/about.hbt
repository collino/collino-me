	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>I grew up in the Midwest but live in Brooklyn, NY. I've been designing for the web since around 2000. A lot has changed since then, but my approach and fundamental beliefs are the same. I design for the open web and start with what is now called a mobile first approach. I have always believed that to be able to design for the web you also need to be able to develop for it. In fact, I had never separated web design and front end development until I worked for a large agency.</p>

	<p>I am very much influenced by great typography, spend a great deal of time listening to music and thinking about art. As much as computers of all sizes are a part of my day, I look forward to time away from them. I've been able to draw since I can first remember, and love the outdoors. I'm an avid cyclist, and also spend a quarter of the year with a bunch of other crazies racing Cyclocross.</p>

# Google Chrome OS

The overarching goal for UXA at the time was to create a unified design language for all of Google.

The goal for this sprint was to test our existing UI design framework in the Chrome OS setting and provide a recommendation for the Chrome OS designers. How would our web and mobile application design toolset work in a desktop OS?

Only some key screens and parts of the OS were chosen to go through this test. They were the file browser, image browser, video/media player, settings, and desktop image selection.

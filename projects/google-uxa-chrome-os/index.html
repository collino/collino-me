			<h1>Google UXA – Chrome OS</h1>
			<p class="lead">The goal of UXA was to create a single design language and UI framework to transform all of Google’s apps into a beautiful, consistent, mature and accessible platform for its users. Our work grew into the <a href="http://google.com/design">Material Design</a> project.</p>
			<p class="caption">Role: UI design</p>
		</header>
		<p>The goal for this sprint was to test our existing UI design framework in the Chrome OS setting and provide a recommendation for the Chrome OS designers. How would our web and mobile application design toolset work in a desktop OS?</p>
<p>Only some key screens and parts of the OS were chosen to go through this test. They were the file browser, image browser, video/media player, settings, and desktop image selection.</p>
